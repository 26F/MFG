# MFG
Silly random midi file generator made with Python and MIDIUtil

expression range. Usually around 2000, 3000 works ok.

Type yes or no for drums.

Type yes to set speed, else it will do so randomly.

If yes try around 500.

The number of files you want created.

This was an experimental project made for fun so don't expect any mozart.
